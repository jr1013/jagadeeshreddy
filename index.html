            is determined by the UV light exposure of the Sun rather than DNA.
            Every day tons of cosmic dust fall on the earth causing Sun rays to
            get refracted and scattered while passing through the dust. Delhi
            roads are filled with the microparticles of dust caused by the
            pollution and the lights do get scattered hence the rays get twice
            refracted. Cosmic Dust can't be the cause of one's suffocation 2019
