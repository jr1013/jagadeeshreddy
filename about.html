    <p class="spacer20">Jagadeesh Reddy is a Filmmaker and multimedia art
      practitioner based in New Delhi, India. His works expose the human and his
      relation to the flora, fauna, and inanimate objects surrounded him.
      Stepping into someone's shoe or placing psychologically in the space of
      life or the objects is the key essence of his works, Jagadeesh's works
      deal somewhere in the junction of a belief in the animism and the
      anthropological construct. His influence was driven towards the fauna
      while volunteering in a zoo park. Most of his works deal with the
      historical narratives, mythologies, and their co-relation and co-existence
      with the flora, fauna surrounde d by humans.</p>
